// UPDATE ROADMAP //
////////////////////

To view recent changes and updates, see changelog.txt.

This pack is updated about once per week! My schedule is here: https://untiedgames.com/schedule
I usually add both new free and paid effects in each update.

Coming soon: A visual guide which shows all the effects at a glance, so you can easily pick the one you're looking for.

// HOW TO USE THIS ASSET PACK //
////////////////////////////////

Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders named PNG and spritesheet. In either folder, you will find the effects sorted into broad categories, detailed in guide.txt.

- The PNG folder contains all the effect animations separated into their own folders, with the frames as individual PNG files.

- The spritesheet folder contains all the effect animations separated into their own folders, but with the frames packed into a single image. A metadata file is alongside each spritesheet which may be used to parse the image.

- In each animation folder, you'll find multiple size variants (both free + paid versions) and color themes (paid version only) of the same animation. For example, in PNG/Explosions/epic_explosion_001, you'll find epic_explosion_001_large_blue, where the suffix indicates the size (large) and the color theme (blue).

- Recommended animation FPS: 15 (66.7 ms/frame)
